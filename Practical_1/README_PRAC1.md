This practical has two sections namely:
1. Practical_1A - Focuses on an intr0duction to programming the STM32F0 in C using STMCUBEIDE
2. Practical_1B - Focuses on benchmarking the STM32F0 using the Mandelbrot set. (Control was generated by running a Python script on a Laptop)

For Practical_1A the following was expected:
1. Implement a Delay for led display without using HAL_DELAY
2. Configure 3 led display modes that are to be triggered via button press
3. Perform a demonstration of the functioning code

For Practical_1B the following was expected:
1. Implement code to generate the Mandelbrot for various image dimensions using both floating point and fixed point arithmetic.
2. Generate a control Mandelbrot set for benchmarking using a python script(Script was provided)
3. Document the findings of the practical in a report.
